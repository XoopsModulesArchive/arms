ArMS KNOWNBUGS.txt
==================

[ ACTIVE ] Delete Moderator return SQL error... When I copy query to phpMyAdmin
           (v 2.5.3) it is executed without any errors
[ ACTIVE ] art_views and page_views db field is not updated. I always get SQL
           error. Same thing with previous bug... Without this field inc View
           Popular is useless. (view.php - view artical)
           
[ FIXED ] In some parts of module I didn`t checked user permissions...

          I copy query to phpMyAdmin it is executed without any problems...

[ FIXED ] My articals page is not finished.
[ FIXED ] Design is different in some parts of module... Made to look like NEWS module
