 As long as zero is in front of ArMS version ArMS is in beta...

 I use ArMS myself! Since I wrote ArMS 0.2 I noticed some things are missing.
 This version should do 75% of what I want from ArMS. Also, I think some of
 ArMS 0.3 features are pure overkill so I added an extra options to admin if you
 don`t need them (or don`t know what to do with them).

 Lang changes are marked ( comment at the end of line ).

 If you used ArMS 0.2 then you`ll need to wait for ArMS 0.4. Simple Update from
 Module admin wont work (database changes :( ). I started codding ArMS update
 routine (puts data to temp table, and after reinstallation of ArMS puts them
 in new tables). I realy don`t have time to finish it... Please, try to wait one
 week, and you`ll have ArMS 0.4 (bug fixes for ArMS 0.3 + update system)

 How to update?
 ==============

 Wait for ArMS 0.4... :(
